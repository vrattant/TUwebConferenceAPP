## Motivation ##

Since the workforce and student strength of Thapar University is increasing at a fast pace, it is not possible to provide the required infrastructure for the same so quickly. A Web Conference Application can enable students to attend guest lectures, talks and seminars from their hostels/classrooms so there is no trouble for finding accommodations for them. Even student participation in these events is difficult to record manually but the application solves this problem. Faculty members can hold meetings among themselves using this platform. They can review the notes associated with any meeting they were part of using the application.
